The employee management system implemented using Java Servlets and JDBC is a web-based application that enables the management of employee data. It utilizes a relational database to store employee records, including information such as employee ID, name, salary, and designation. 

The system includes servlets that handle different functionalities, such as viewing employees, adding new employees, updating employee information, and deleting employees. JDBC is used to establish a connection with the database and perform database operations. The system provides a user interface, typically implemented using HTML and CSS.
